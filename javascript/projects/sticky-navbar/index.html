      <h2>HTML: HyperText Markup Language</h2>
      <p>
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the
        Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other
        technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's
        appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another,
        either within a single website or between websites. Links are a
        fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and
        linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active
        participant in the World Wide Web.
      </p>
      At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which
      can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a
      document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a
      table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a
      header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content
      such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the
      first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need
      to know to understand HTML.
      <p>
        You don't need any previous HTML knowledge, but you should have at least
        basic familiarity with using computers and using the web passively
        (i.e., just looking at it and consuming content). You should have a
        basic work environment set up (as detailed in Installing basic
        software), and understand how to create and manage files (as detailed in
        Dealing with files). Both are parts of our Getting started with the web
        complete beginner's module.
      </p>

      <h2>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</h2>

      <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe
        the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML
        dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements
        should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized
        across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously,
        development of various parts of CSS specification was done
        synchronously, which allowed versioning of the latest recommendations.
        You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, CSS3. However, CSS4 has never
        become an official version.
      </p>
      <p>
        From CSS3, the scope of the specification increased significantly and
        the progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much, that it
        became more effective to develop and release recommendations separately
        per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now
        periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state of the CSS
        specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages —
        for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your
        content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other
        decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your
        path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the
        syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to
        HTML.
      </p>

      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled
        programming language with first-class functions. While it is most
        well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser
        environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe
        Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm,
        single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented,
        imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read
        more about JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the
        parts that are specific to Web pages or other host environments. For
        information about API specifics to Web pages, please see Web APIs and
        DOM.
      </p>

        class="align-left slide-in"
      />

      <p>
        The standard for JavaScript is ECMAScript. As of 2012, all modern
        browsers fully support ECMAScript 5.1. Older browsers support at least
        ECMAScript 3. On June 17, 2015, ECMA International published the sixth
        major version of ECMAScript, which is officially called ECMAScript 2015,
        and was initially referred to as ECMAScript 6 or ES6. Since then,
        ECMAScript standards are on yearly release cycles. This documentation
        refers to the latest draft version, which is currently ECMAScript 2020.
      </p>

      <p>
        Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both
        "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of
        Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming
        languages have a very different syntax, semantic, and use.

      <h3>Looping code</h3>
      <p>
        Sometimes you need a task done more than once in a row. For example,
        looking through a list of names. In programming, loops perform this job
        very well. Here we will look at loop structures in JavaScript.
      </p>

      />
      <h3>Functions — reusable blocks of code</h3>
      <p>
        Another essential concept in coding is functions. Functions allow you to
        store a piece of code that does a single task inside a defined block,
        and then call that code whenever you need it using a single short
        command — rather than having to type out the same code multiple times.
        In this article we'll explore fundamental concepts behind functions such
        as basic syntax, how to invoke and define functions, scope, and
        parameters.
      </p>
      <h3>Events</h3>
      <p>
        Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are
        programming, which the system tells you about so you can respond to them
        in some way if desired. For example if the user clicks a button on a
        webpage, you might want to respond to that action by displaying an
        information box. In this final article we will discuss some important
        concepts surrounding events, and look at how they work in browsers.
