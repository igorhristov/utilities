        <h2>Why Flexbox?</h2>
        <p>
          For a long time, the only reliable cross browser-compatible tools
          available for creating CSS layouts were things like floats and
          positioning. These are fine, and they work, but in some ways they are
          also rather limiting and frustrating.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following simple layout requirements are either difficult or
          impossible to achieve with such tools, in any kind of convenient,
          flexible way:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.</li>
          <li>
            Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of
            the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is
            available.
          </li>
          <li>
            Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height
            even if they contain a different amount of content.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As you'll see in subsequent sections, flexbox makes a lot of layout
          tasks much easier. Let's dig in!
        </p>
        <h2>The flex model</h2>
        <p>
          When elements are laid out as flex items, they are laid out along two
          axes:
        </p>
        <img
          src="https://media.prod.mdn.mozit.cloud/attachments/2012/07/09/3739/97750afee8f091f8b82864be884a3695/flex_terms.png"
          alt="flexbox"
        />
        <ul>
          <li>
            The main axis is the axis running in the direction the flex items
            are being laid out in e.g. as rows across the page, or columns down
            the page. The start and end of this axis are called the main start
            and main end.
          </li>
          <li>
            The cross axis is the axis running perpendicular to the direction
            the flex items are being laid out in. The start and end of this axis
            are called the cross start and cross end.
          </li>
          <li>
            The parent element that has display: flex set on it the section in
            our example is called the flex container.
          </li>
          <li>
            The items being laid out as flexible boxes inside the flex container
            are called flex items
          </li>
        </ul>

        <img
          src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/00-basic-terminology.svg"
          alt=""
        />
        <p>
          If “regular” layout is based on both block and inline flow directions,
          the flex layout is based on “flex-flow directions”. Please have a look
          at this figure from the specification, explaining the main idea behind
          the flex layout.
        </p>
        <h2>Properties for the Parent <br />(flex container)</h2>

        <h3>flex-direction</h3>
        <img
          src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/flex-direction.svg"
          alt=""
        />
        <p>
          This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items
          are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside from optional
          wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of flex items as
          primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.
        </p>
        <h3>flex-wrap</h3>
        <img
          src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/flex-wrap.svg"
          alt=""
        />
        <p>
          By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can
          change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>nowrap (default): all flex items will be on one line</li>
          <li>
            wrap: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, from top to bottom.
          </li>
          <li>
            wrap-reverse: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines from bottom
            to top.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>justify-content</h3>
        <img
          src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/justify-content.svg"
          alt=""
        />
        <p>
          This defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute
          extra free space leftover when either all the flex items on a line are
          inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. It
          also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they
          overflow the line.
        </p>

        <ul style="clear: both">
          <li>
            flex-start (default): items are packed toward the start of the
            flex-direction.
          </li>
          <li>
            flex-end: items are packed toward the end of the flex-direction.
          </li>
          <li>
            start: items are packed toward the start of the writing-mode
            direction.
          </li>
          <li>
            end: items are packed toward the end of the writing-mode direction.
          </li>
          <li>
            left: items are packed toward left edge of the container, unless
            that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction, then it behaves
            like start
          </li>
          <li>
            right: items are packed toward right edge of the container, unless
            that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction, then it behaves
            like start.
          </li>
          <li>center: items are centered along the line</li>
          <li>
            space-between: items are evenly distributed in the line; first item
            is on the start line, last item on the end line
          </li>
          <li>
            space-around: items are evenly distributed in the line with equal
            space around them. Note that visually the spaces aren’t equal, since
            all the items have equal space on both sides. The first item will
            have one unit of space against the container edge, but two units of
            space between the next item because that next item has its own
            spacing that applies.
          </li>
          <li>
            space-evenly: items are distributed so that the spacing between any
            two items (and the space to the edges) is equal.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
          Properties for the Children <br />
          (flex items)
        </h2>
        <h3>order</h3>
        <img
          src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/order.svg"
          alt=""
        />
        <p>
          By default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the
          order property controls the order in which they appear in the flex
          container.
        </p>
        <h3 style="clear: both">flex-grow</h3>
        <img
          src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/flex-grow.svg"
          alt=""
        />
        <p>
          This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It
          accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what
          amount of the available space inside the flex container the item
          should take up.
        </p>
        <p>
          If all items have flex-grow set to 1, the remaining space in the
          container will be distributed equally to all children. If one of the
          children has a value of 2, the remaining space would take up twice as
          much space as the others (or it will try to, at least). <br />
          Negative numbers are invalid.
        </p>

        <h3>flex-shrink</h3>
        <p>This defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary.</p>
        <h3>flex-basis</h3>
        <p>
          This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space
          is distributed. It can be a length (e.g. 20%, 5rem, etc.) or a
          keyword. The auto keyword means “look at my width or height property”
          (which was temporarily done by the main-size keyword until
          deprecated). The content keyword means “size it based on the item’s
          content” – this keyword isn’t well supported yet, so it’s hard to test
          and harder to know what its brethren max-content, min-content, and
          fit-content do.
        </p>

        <h3>flex</h3>
        <p>
          This is the shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis
          combined. The second and third parameters (flex-shrink and flex-basis)
          are optional. The default is 0 1 auto, but if you set it with a single
          number value, it’s like 1 0.
        </p>

        <h3>align-self</h3>
        <img
          src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/align-self.svg"
          alt=""
        />
        <p>
          This allows the default alignment (or the one specified by
          align-items) to be overridden for individual flex items.
